# Video-To-Noise-Converter
 I saw this effect on YouTube and I wanted to recreate it. Basically, this script converts a video to 1-bit color (pure black or white), then generates a random noise image, and inverts the noise based on the brightness of the image. This creates an effect where, when paused, looks like just noise, but when playing, you can see outlines in the video.
